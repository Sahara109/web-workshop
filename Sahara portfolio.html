<h1>Hey ! I am Sahara Khan .</h1>

<img src ="sahara.jpg" alt="saharakhan.jpg" width="200" height ="200">
<p>My name Sahara Khan . I turned eighteen this year in August . I live in Gyaneshwor, Kathmandu . I am a student of BIT and i am in level 4 i.e. this is my first year . I am very excited to learn new things and to get the exposure of innovative and creative ideas . I have passed my +2 this year with 3.78 GPA with my major subject Business Studies. I wanted to study IT to broaden my career paths as it is a very multidimensional field .I really like to sketch characters . I do it in my free time . I love to listen music and watch series as well . I like to play Badminton and Basketball . I have learned Calligraphy and also I  also like to play Piano .<br>I  created my own Yoputube channel a year back to post my art on the internet but I discontinued it beacause of my +2 board exam . But I am thinking of continuing it . As there is nothing that can make you more happier than your own personal interest.I have also posted a couple of shorts in my channel . I don't have a lot of time to give on sketching but I try to make  anime characters in my free time . </p>
